This is the `data` folder. This folder contains the `shapefiles` and `archive` folder.   
  
The `data` folder contains:  
  
- `harvest_trans.csv` = all possible harvestable wild reef transects in the Big Bend from ArcGIS; this is in the `lcr_project_master_data` repo in the `arcgis` folder; this should never change unless the sampling area changes
- `nonharvest_trans.csv` = all possible non-harvestable wild reef transects in the Big Bend from ArcGIS; this is in the `lcr_project_master_data` repo in the `arcgis` folder; this should never change unless the sampling area changes
- `lc_centerline_seg.csv` = the center of LCR segments from ArcGIS
- `rand_seg.csv` = a list of possible transect segments for oyster heights

The `archive` folder contains old (previous years) data and random draws.
